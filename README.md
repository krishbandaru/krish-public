# Handy Scripts to automate tasks

## iTunesPlaylistExporter.py
Script to copy all files referenced in an iTunes playlist to a new directory.  I used this to explicitly copy music files from my main library to my Plex server.

## SpotifyPlaybackController.py
Simple script to control Spotify playback.  Requires setting up a dev account and creating a dev app to obtain client_id and client_secret.  Store those in a .env file.

Reusable class to connect to and manipulate your Spotify account.

## TestSpotifyClass.py
Simple use case for the Spotify.py class.
